-- in this task to create student database management,first we need to create a databse
called student_management--

CREATE DATABASE student_management;

--for using the database we use below command--

USE student_management;

--in student_management database, we created a table named students consists of different 
colomn headings and their datatypes with constraints like student_id int etc.--

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    birthdate DATE,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15)
);

--we create another table as we know that names mentioned in the task named members consists of different 
colomn headings and their datatypes with constraints like course_id int etc.--

CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    course_description TEXT
);

--at final we create table named enrollments in the database which consisting of
colomn headings and their datatypes with constraints like enrollment_id int etc.--

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    grade CHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);

-- after creating the tables we need to insert the data into empty tables to store the data--
--for inserting data we use below query syntax to insert data in a above created tables--

INSERT INTO students (name, birthdate, email, phone_number)
VALUES ('Alice Johnson', '2000-05-14', 'alice.johnson@example.com', '123-456-7890'),
       ('Bob Smith', '1999-08-22', 'bob.smith@example.com', '098-765-4321');
INSERT INTO courses (course_name, course_description)
VALUES ('Mathematics', 'Study of numbers, shapes, and patterns'),
       ('History', 'Study of past events');
INSERT INTO enrollments (student_id, course_id, grade)
VALUES (1, 1, 'A'),
       (2 ,2, 'B'),
       (2, 1, 'B');

--for updating the data in tables we use below syntax--

drop table courses;
UPDATE students SET email = 'alice.newemail@example.com' WHERE student_id = 1;
UPDATE courses SET course_description = 'Advanced study of past events' WHERE course_id = 2;
UPDATE enrollments SET grade = 'A' WHERE enrollment_id = 2;

--for deleting the data we use below syntax--

DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 1;
DELETE FROM courses WHERE course_id = 1;
DELETE FROM enrollments WHERE student_id = 1;
DELETE FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 1;

--for getting the data that is stored in tables we use below syntax--

set sql_safe_updates=0;
SELECT * FROM students;
SELECT * FROM courses;
SELECT * FROM enrollments;

--for getting the students enrolled by a specific course we use below syntax--

SELECT s.name, e.grade
FROM enrollments e
JOIN students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
WHERE e.course_id = 2;

-- for getting course who enrolled a specific student we use below syntax--

SELECT c.course_name, e.grade
FROM enrollments e
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE e.student_id = 2;
